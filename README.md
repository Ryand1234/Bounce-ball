# Bounce Ball

## Bounce Ball
This Web App will show the trajectory of ball when fall from height and in a 2-D motion.

## index.html
This page will show trajectory when ball fall from a height h and cofficient of restitution cor. The height can vary from 10 to 100 while cor can vary from 0.0 to 1.0. 
### Equation used:
- cor^2 = height of rebound / initial height

## motion.html
This page will show trajectory when ball move in a 2-D. The trajectry will vary with velocity, angle and acceleration due to gravity.
### Equation used:
- height = distance * tan(angle) - ((distance)^2 * g * sec^2(angle)) / 2 * velocity^2
